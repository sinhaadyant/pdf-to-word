Things to Remember for Backend
1. Constants & Configurations

✅ Define constants in a separate config file (config/constants.js):

Allowed file types (application/pdf).

Max file size (e.g., 10MB).

Upload directory (e.g., /uploads).

Temp/Output directory for converted DOCX files.

✅ Use dotenv (.env) for:

Port

Python executable path

Any 3rd-party API keys (if used later)

2. Validations

File validation

Reject non-PDF uploads.

Restrict file size.

Ensure filename sanitization (avoid path traversal attacks).

Request validation

Use Zod / Joi for validating request bodies.

If extending API later (e.g., batch upload, metadata), validate strictly.

3. Security

✅ Sanitize uploaded file names.

 
✅ Delete files after processing to avoid storage bloat.

✅ Implement rate limiting & request size limiting to avoid DoS attacks.

✅ Use HTTPS if in production.

4. Error Handling

✅ Wrap  Python calls with try-catch.

✅ Provide clear error messages if:

Python script fails

File not supported

Conversion timeout

✅ Use a centralized error handler middleware in Express.

5. Performance

✅ Run Python script asynchronously (don’t block Node.js event loop).
  
6. Logging

✅ Use winston or pino for logging:

Request logs

Conversion success/failure logs

Error stack traces

✅ Save logs with timestamps for debugging.

7. Folder Structure (Recommended)
backend/
 ├── config/
 │   └── constants.js
 ├── controllers/
 │   └── fileController.js
 ├── routes/
 │   └── fileRoutes.js
 ├── middlewares/
 │   └── errorHandler.js
 │   └── validateFile.js
 ├── uploads/
 ├── converted/
 ├── app.js
 ├── server.js
 └── package.json

8. Future Enhancements

Multiple file uploads (batch processing).

Queue system for large PDFs.

Conversion progress tracking.
